**Inspiration

Losing something valuable to you is not a good feeling. I lost my bag full of personal documents on my way to Texas last week in a hackathon program at University of Texas at Austin. I panicked and it was important. Someone could have found it and I wished I would have known the person somehow or that person could let me know that he/she had found it. So I came up with an idea of building an app that lets people know about what they have lost.

**What it does?

If someone finds anything, they just only submit a photo of it, add their name, and give the relevant information about the item. This would facilitate the app's use in making things more easily accessible. A phone call's feature to reach a person who has misplaced an item and found it is also available.

**How we built it?

We built this app by using flutter, google cloud storage, Firestore, Google map API, Dart, Java, 3D graphics, kotlin, Google login API and Firebase auth.

**Obstacles we faced while developing this application

We faced multiple bugs while integrating different APIs and handling databases. The addition of 3D graphics also presented some challenges for us, but in the end, it was simple. Additionally, there were various obstacles and hurdles in developing a user-friendly user interface.

**Accomplishments that we achieved

• Facilitating the ability to call the owner of the item directly. • Facilitating the user in securely storing their data and making it available to the user. • We accomplished good use of graphics and UI design. • Finally, we are pleased with our accomplishments and teamwork for carrying out our plan effectively within the time limit.

**What we learned?

We learned and enjoyed our project a lot. We improved our abilities to cooperate and speak with one another. While creating the application, we also gained knowledge about 3D graphics integration. We learned to connect the google API while developing an app in flutter.

**What are the Future Steps?

In order to monitor exactly where the individual found the item, we intend to integrate the Google Maps function in the near future. For the various products, we also intend to integrate the meta data option. To filter and display items within a certain distance, we might implement a distance Search function.
